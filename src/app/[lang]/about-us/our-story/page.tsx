					<h1>Our Mission at Wigglz</h1>

					<p>At Wigglz, our passion is to uplift the health and spirit of every pet. With
						a commitment to superior nutrition and natural products, we envision a future
						where every pet in Lebanon thrives with vitality and joy.
					</p>

					<p>We're staunch believers that "you are what you eat" is not solely a human
						principle.
					</p>

					<p>Our Wigglz story is a budding one, rooted in Lebanon's rich landscape. As
						young professionals deeply connected to our homeland, the yearning to
						expand our family led us to the playful embrace of an English Bulldog named
						Rolo.
					</p>

					<p>Yet, as Rolo began to exhibit health concerns, our investigative instincts
						were ignited. We started to question the standard pet foods available in the
						local market, suspecting they might be the culprits behind Rolo's issues.
						Dive deep we did, and to our dismay, we uncovered a myriad of additives and unnatural
						ingredients in so-called "premium" foods.
					</p>

					<p>With this knowledge, we embarked on an experimental journey, introducing Rolo to a diet
						rich in raw, fresh ingredients. The transformation was both rapid and profound.
						From a rejuvenated coat to boundless energy, Rolo became the living testament to
						the power of natural nutrition.
					</p>

					<p>Spurred by our personal experience, we felt an urge to share this revelation with
						Lebanon'spet community. If Rolo could benefit so significantly, imagine the potential
						for pets all over the country! This inspiration was the seed from which Wigglz sprouted.
					</p>

					<p>While we're in our infancy as a startup, our ambition is vast. Collaborating with local
						farmers, sourcing ethical meats, and blending in the freshest organic oils, our aim
						is tocraft balanced, raw meals that meet global standards.
					</p>

					<p>Though our venture is young, we're bolstered by supportive local ties, including
						a burgeoning community of pet lovers who share our vision.
					</p>

					<p>As Wigglz evolves, our primary badge of honor will be our unwavering
						integrity and the dream to transform Lebanon's pet nutrition landscape.
						We believe in our mission, and with every meal, treat, or product, we hope to empower
						pet owners to bestow their pets with a life brimming with health and happiness.
					</p>

					<p>Join us on this budding journey, and let's co-create a brighter, healthier future
						for pets in Lebanon. Because with Wigglz, nature's finest is just a bite away.
